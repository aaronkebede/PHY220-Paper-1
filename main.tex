This report provides insight into the analysis of R-C Circuits using signal generators. We study circuits in three steps. First, we study a very simple circuit just consisting of a resistor, a capacitor element, and a signal generator. The signal generator generates a current with a specific frequency which we can then vary to study the effects on the other circuit elements. Second, we add an amplifier to the circuit to
We record our data and analyze it to find that  We then hand recorded the data by varying the On the second part, we study
